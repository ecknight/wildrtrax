# wildrtrax 

# wildrtrax 1.5

## Major changes 

* Move to support WildTrax 2.0 APIs; `wt_get_download_summary()` is replaced by `wt_get_projects()`
* New function `wt_format_audiomoth_filenames()` serves to add location prefixes for [AudioMoth](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/audiomoth) data containing only date times
* New function `wt_get_exif()` extracts all EXIF information from desired image files in Projects
* New function `wt_guano_tags()`
* New function `wt_get_views()`
* New function `wt_get_project_species()` to extract species lists from a specific Project
* `wt_download_report()` no longer explicitly removes weather columns
* Queries benchmarked as 2-3x on new production server at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada

# wildrtrax 1.4

## Major changes

* New function, `wt_get_sync()`, allows users to get columns and data from syncs (upload / download and table views) across the system. Functionally replaces `wt_get_recordings()`, `wt_get_locations()`, `wt_get_visits()`, `wt_get_image_sets()` in one smooth function relevant to the Organization or Project needed.
* Fixed a bug that incorrectly adjusted time zones in `wt_qpad_offsets()`. This bug affected QPAD offsets used for [species with time since sunrise in the top model](https://github.com/borealbirds/QPAD-offsets-correction/blob/main/qpad_tssr_species.csv) and in areas outside the Mountain Time Zone (MST/MDT). For more information, please see the [BAM QPAD correction repository](https://github.com/borealbirds/QPAD-offsets-correction) for further details or email bamp@ualberta.ca for assistance.

## Minor changes

* Additional argument to `wt_summarise_cam()` using `image_set_id` to adjust for effort across multiple deployments (see [#80](https://github.com/ABbiodiversity/wildrtrax/issues/80)); additional enhancements for `wt_ind_detect()` (see [#81](https://github.com/ABbiodiversity/wildrtrax/issues/81), [#82](https://github.com/ABbiodiversity/wildrtrax/issues/82).
* #84 through e2e181a for `wt_ind_detect()`, species detections are now generated separately for each species and then combined afterward into a single output.
* Fixed bugs and enhanced usage of `wt_kaleidoscope_tags()` (see [#77](https://github.com/ABbiodiversity/wildrtrax/issues/77)).

# wildrtrax 1.3.3

## Major changes

* Continued GET request support with new functions: `wt_get_visits()`, `wt_get_recordings()`, `wt_get_image_sets()`, `wt_get_project_species()`
* `wt_get_threshold` becomes `wt_classifier_threshold()` to distinguish from other GET functions

## Minor changes

* Camera function maintenance for [#70](https://github.com/ABbiodiversity/wildrtrax/issues/70); increasing camera test suites for common permutations 
* Branching development to prepare package for WildTrax 2.0.
* Introduced the `max_seconds` argument in `wt_download_report()` to provide customizable timeout control for users with slower internet connections or larger project downloads.
* Remove QPAD from Remotes. Users should be prompted to download QPAD separately if not already installed. Fix in timezone ([#78](https://github.com/ABbiodiversity/wildrtrax/pull/78)).

# wildrtrax 1.3.2

* Use `.wt_col_types()` to dynamically adjust column reports to help address ([#55](https://github.com/ABbiodiversity/wildrtrax/issues/55))
* Moved `wt_calculate_prf()` to internal function

# wildrtrax 1.3.0

## Major changes

* Addition of five new functions: 
  * `wt_dd_summary()` for querying data from Data Discover. See [APIs](https://abbiodiversity.github.io/wildrtrax/articles/apis.html#data-discover) for more information
  * `wt_evaluate_classifier()`, `wt_get_threshold()`, and `wt_additional_species()` for wrangling acoustic automated classification results. See [Acoustic classifiers](https://abbiodiversity.github.io/wildrtrax/articles/classifiers-tutorial.html) for more information.
  * `wt_add_grts()` to intersect locations with GRTS IDs from [NABat](https://www.nabatmonitoring.org/)
* `wt_download_tags()` now becomes `wt_download_media()` to support broader media downloads in batch from WildTrax
* Deprecated `wt_report()`

## Minor changes

* Switch to `curl::curl_download()` for media and assets
* Removed dependencies `pipeR`, `progressr`, `jsonlite`, `future`, `furrr`, `tools`, `magrittr`, `markdown`, `rmarkdown` to increase package stability but reduces speed for functions such as `wt_audio_scanner()`, `wt_run_ap()`. Moved `vembedr` to suggests for vignettes
* Switched `wt_download_report()` to POST requests
* Lowercase package name
