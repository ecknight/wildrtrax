# wildrtrax 

# wildrtrax 1.3.4

## Major changes

* New functions: `wt_get_sync_columns()` allowing users to get all columns from syncs across the system and `wt_get_project_tags()` to get tag data from ARU project sync

## Minor changes

* Additional argument to `wt_summarise_cam()` using `image_set_id` to adjust for effort across multiple deployments (see #80); additional enhancements for `wt_ind_detect()` (see #81, #82)
* Fixed bugs in usage of `wt_kaleidoscope_tags()` (see #77).
* Fixed a bug that incorrectly adjusted time zones in `wt_qpad_offsets()`. This bug affected QPAD offsets used for [species with time since sunrise in the top model](https://github.com/borealbirds/QPAD-offsets-correction/blob/main/qpad_tssr_species.csv) and in areas outside the Mountain Time Zone (MST/MDT). For more information, please see the [BAM QPAD correction repository](https://github.com/borealbirds/QPAD-offsets-correction) for further details or email bamp@ualberta.ca for assistance

# wildrtrax 1.3.3

## Major changes

* Continued GET request support with new functions: `wt_get_visits()`, `wt_get_recordings()`, `wt_get_image_sets()`, `wt_get_project_species()`
* `wt_get_threshold` becomes `wt_classifier_threshold()` to distinguish from other GET functions

## Minor changes

* Camera function maintenance for [#70](https://github.com/ABbiodiversity/wildrtrax/issues/70); increasing camera test suites for common permutations 
* Branching development to prepare package for WildTrax 2.0
* Introduced the `max_seconds` argument in `wt_download_report()` to provide customizable timeout control for users with slower internet connections or larger project downloads
* Remove QPAD from Remotes. Users should be prompted to download QPAD separately if not already installed. Fix in timezone ([#78](https://github.com/ABbiodiversity/wildrtrax/pull/78)).

# wildrtrax 1.3.2

## Major changes

* Add GRTS grid cells for Alaska and contiguous United States for `wt_add_grts()` ([#64](https://github.com/ABbiodiversity/wildrtrax/issues/64))
* Use `.wt_col_types()` to dynamically adjust column reports to help address ([#55](https://github.com/ABbiodiversity/wildrtrax/issues/55))
* Moved `wt_calculate_prf()` to internal function

# wildrtrax 1.3.0

## Major changes

* Addition of five new functions: 
  * `wt_dd_summary()` for querying data from Data Discover. See [APIs](https://abbiodiversity.github.io/wildrtrax/articles/apis.html#data-discover) for more information
  * `wt_evaluate_classifier()`, `wt_get_threshold()`, and `wt_additional_species()` for wrangling acoustic automated classification results. See [Acoustic classifiers](https://abbiodiversity.github.io/wildrtrax/articles/classifiers-tutorial.html) for more information.
  * `wt_add_grts()` to intersect locations with GRTS IDs from [NABat](https://www.nabatmonitoring.org/)
* `wt_download_tags()` now becomes `wt_download_media()` to support broader media downloads in batch from WildTrax
* Deprecated `wt_report()`

## Minor changes

* Switch to `curl::curl_download()` for media and assets
* Removed dependencies `pipeR`, `progressr`, `jsonlite`, `future`, `furrr`, `tools`, `magrittr`, `markdown`, `rmarkdown` to increase package stability but reduces speed for functions such as `wt_audio_scanner()`, `wt_run_ap()`. Moved `vembedr` to suggests for vignettes
* Switched `wt_download_report()` to POST requests
* Lowercase package name

# wildrtrax 1.2.0

## Major changes

* `wt_chop()` now recurses across all input files
* Moving geospatial assets to new repository to lighten package size. Asset requests are now made only through usage of `wt_qpad_offsets()`.

## Minor changes

* Improvements to APIs and acoustic convenience functions to resolve issues and PRs
* Improvements to test suite, testing dependencies, code coverage
* Addition of [Camera data wrangling vignette](https://abbiodiversity.github.io/wildrtrax/articles/camera-data-wrangling.html) and additional [tutorials](https://abbiodiversity.github.io/wildrtrax/articles/tutorials.html)

# wildrtrax 1.1.0

## Major changes

* `wildrtrax` now honours new WildTrax report structures. Future changes will incorporate standardized naming in syncing functions.

Users should re-download the package by October 2023 in-line with the former package retirement: https://geocompx.org/post/2023/rgdal-retirement/.

## Minor changes

* Tweaks to [Acoustic data wrangling](https://abbiodiversity.github.io/wildrtrax/articles/acoustic-data-wrangling.html) for (#16)
* Addition of geospatial assets. Users should be warned package size is now ~40 MB.
* Moved TMTT predictions from csv to .RDS file.
