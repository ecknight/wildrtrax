\usage{
wt_evaluate_classifier(
  data,
  resolution = "recording",
  remove_species = TRUE,
  species = NULL,
  thresholds = c(0.01, 0.9)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Output from the \code{wt_download_report()} function when you request the \code{main} and \code{ai} reports}

\item{resolution}{Character; either "recording" to summarize at the entire recording level or "minute" to summarize the minute level if the \code{task_method} is "1SPM", or "task"}

\item{remove_species}{Logical; indicates whether species that are not allowed in the WildTrax project should be removed from the AI report}

\item{species}{Character; optional subset of species to calculate metrics for (e.g., species = c("OVEN", "OSFL", "BOCH"))}

\item{thresholds}{Numeric; start and end of sequence of score thresholds at which to calculate performance metrics}
}
\value{
A tibble containing columns for precision, recall, and F-score for each of the requested thresholds.
}
\description{
Calculates precision, recall, and F-score of BirdNET and/or HawkEars for a requested sequence of thresholds. You can request the metrics at the minute level for recordings that are processed with the species per minute method (1SPM).
