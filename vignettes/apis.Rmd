## Overview

The purpose of this vignette is to provide a clear introduction to accessing and interacting with WildTrax through our R package. 

An *API* (Application Programming Interface) is a way for one program to communicate with another over the internet. In this case, the WildTrax APIs lets R talk to WildTrax servers to retrieve project data, recordings or tag information without using the website's user interface manually. 

`wildrtrax` *wraps* the WildTrax API in R functions, so you can easily authenticate, request data, and work with it in your analysis. You don’t have to write HTTP requests or handle tokens directly—our package handles these details and provides user-friendly R functions to interact with WildTrax programmatically.

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = '#>'
)
```

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# Attach package
library(wildrtrax)
library(dplyr)

load("package.RData")
#save.image("package.RData")
```

## Authenticating to WildTrax

Before accessing WildTrax data, you need to authenticate to obtain a token. This token lets the server recognize you and grant access to your data. Currently, authentication is done via **Auth0 login** (Google login is not supported). To simplify repeated use, store your WildTrax username and password as environment variables in R. This allows the package to securely use your credentials without requiring you to type them each time.


```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
# Note that you need to use 'WT_USERNAME' and 'WT_PASSWORD'
Sys.setenv(WT_USERNAME = 'guest', WT_PASSWORD = 'Apple123')

```

Next, you use the `wt_auth()` function to authenticate.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
# Authenticate
wt_auth()

```

The Auth0 token you obtained will last for 12 hours. After that time, you will need to re-authenticate.

## Making API calls

Once authenticated, you can now use various functions that call upon the WildTrax APIs. For instance, you can use `wt_get_projects()` to see basic metadata about projects that you can download data for.  

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, wanring=F, message=F}
# Download the project summary you have access to
my_projects <- wt_get_projects(sensor = 'ARU')

head(my_projects)
```

Using the project_id number in the download summary you can then use `wt_download_report()` to access the species data. You can also find the project_id number in the url of a WildTrax project, e.g. https://portal.wildtrax.ca/home/aru-tasks.html?projectId=605&sensorId=ARU.

```{r echo=TRUE, include=TRUE, eval=F, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Download the project report
my_report <- wt_download_report(project_id = 620, sensor_id = 'ARU', reports = "main") %>%
  tibble::as_tibble()
```
```{r echo=F, include=F, eval=T, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Download the project report
my_report <- wt_download_report(project_id = 620, sensor_id = 'ARU', reports = "main") %>%
  tibble::as_tibble()
```
```{r, eval=T}
head(my_report)

```

An easy way to download multiple projects at once is to use `wt_get_projects()` and then filter by a substring in order to get the project ids to download the data.

```{r echo=T, include=T, eval=FALSE, warning = F, message = F}
# Download all of the published Ecosystem Health ARU data to a single object
wt_get_projects(sensor_id = "ARU") %>%
  tibble::as_tibble() %>%
  dplyr::filter(grepl('^Ecosystem Health',project)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(data = purrr::map(.x = project_id, .f = ~wt_download_report(project_id = .x, sensor_id = "ARU", reports = "main")))

```
```{r echo=T, include=F, eval=F, warning = F, message = F}
# Download all of the published Ecosystem Health ARU data to a single object
wt_get_projects(sensor_id = "ARU") %>%
  tibble::as_tibble() %>%
  dplyr::filter(grepl('^Ecosystem Health',project)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(data = purrr::map(.x = project_id, .f = ~wt_download_report(project_id = .x, sensor_id = "ARU", reports = "main")))

```

WildTrax also pre-formats ARU to point count (PC) data depending on the type of analysis you wish to perform. See the [Boreal Avian Modelling project](https://borealbirds.ca/) website and GitHub [repositories](https://github.com/borealbirds) to find out more on integration of avian point count and ARU data.

```{r, echo=T, include=T, eval=T, warning=F, message = FALSE}
# As ARU format
my_report
```
```{r, echo=F, include=F, eval=T, warning=F, message = FALSE}
# As point count format
aru_as_pc <- wt_download_report(project_id = 620, sensor_id = 'PC', reports = "main")
```
```{r, eval=T}
# As point count format
head(aru_as_pc)

```

## Species

Downloading the WildTrax species table with `wt_get_species()` also grants you access to other valuable columns or provides a complete list of the species currently supported by WildTrax.

```{r, echo=T, include=T, eval=F, warning=F, message = FALSE}
# Download the WildTrax species table
spp_table <- wt_get_species()
```
```{r, echo=F, include=F, eval=T, warning=F, message = FALSE}
# Download the WildTrax species table
spp_table <- wt_get_species()
```
```{r, eval=T}
spp_table |> arrange(species_code)

```

You can also determine which species are allowed in and out of projects via the `wt_get_project_species()` function. The `included` column will expose which species have been currently tagged in the Project. 

```{r, echo=T, include=T, eval=T, warning=F, message = FALSE}
my_project_species <- wt_get_project_species(620)

my_project_species |>
  filter(included == TRUE)
```

## Data Discover

Explore species and data within WildTrax's [Data Discover](https://discover.wildtrax.ca/) by employing the `wt_dd_summary()` function. Access a portion of data, even without user privileges. Utilize `wt_auth()` to uncover data pertinent to your account or those publicly available on WildTrax.

```{r, echo=T, include=T, eval=F, warning=F, message = FALSE}
discover <- wt_dd_summary(sensor = "ARU", species = "White-throated Sparrow", boundary = NULL)
```
```{r, echo=F, include=F, eval=F, warning=F, message = FALSE}
discover <- wt_dd_summary(sensor = "ARU", species = "White-throated Sparrow", boundary = NULL)
```
```{r, eval=T}
head(discover)

```

Use custom bounding areas:

```{r, echo=T, include=T, eval=F, warning=F, message = FALSE}
# Define a polygon
my_aoi <- list(
  c(-113.96068, 56.23817),
  c(-117.06285, 54.87577),
  c(-112.88035, 54.90431),
  c(-113.96068, 56.23817)
)

discover <- wt_dd_summary(sensor = "ARU", species = "White-throated Sparrow", boundary = my_aoi)

head(discover)

```

```{r, echo=T, include=T, eval=F, warning=F, message = FALSE}
library(sf)
# Alberta bounding box
abbox <- read_sf("...shp") |> # Shapefile of Alberta
  filter(Province == "Alberta") |>
  st_transform(crs = 4326) |> 
  st_bbox()

discover <- wt_dd_summary(sensor = "ARU", species = "White-throated Sparrow", boundary = abbox)

head(discover)

```

## Accessing WildTrax data with `wt_get_sync()` and `wt_get_view()`

`wt_get_sync()` and `wt_get_view()` provide programmatic access to WildTrax data through various APIs. `wt_get_sync()` interfaces with the synchronization (sync) endpoints, which expose data associated with Organizations and Projects. These endpoints return data objects related to locations, visits, deployments, equipment, project tasks, and tags. The sync APIs are primarily intended for workflows that require advanced or batch manipulation. `wt_get_view()` provides access to the user interface views and tables that present structured representations of WildTrax data. These views are optimized for reporting and analysis and may aggregate or normalize information. Used together, `wt_get_sync()` and `wt_get_view()` allow users to retrieve operational data from the WildTrax system and work with analysis-ready representations of those data within R.


![How `wt_get_sync()` and `wt_get_view()` relate to Organization locations](syncs.png)

```{r, echo=T, include=T, eval=F, warning=F, message = FALSE}
# Extracting location information from all API functions

# All location information from Organization location sync
wt_get_sync(api = "organization_locations", organization = 5205)

# All location information from Locations tab
wt_get_view(api = "organization_locations", organization = 5205)

# All location information from Project location sync
wt_get_sync(api = "project_locations", project = 326)

wt_download_report(project_id = 326, sensor_id = 'ARU', reports = 'location')

```
